# Taboola iOS SDK SwiftUI Examples

Taboola SDK allows publishers to display Taboola's Widgets and Feed within their iOS apps.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Taboola iOS SDK, please follow this link [iOS SDK documentation](https://sdk.taboola.com/taboolasdk/docs/taboola-ios-sdk-install?ref=github).
SwiftUI provides a new way of composing layout by following declaritive approach. This tutorial encompasses basics UI components like ListView, ScrollView, VStackView etc. with Taboola placements.
Also, we use Taboola-SwiftUI-Umbrella framework to utilize several essential components which help combine Taboola placement and SwiftUI in an easy way with less effort.
